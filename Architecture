Below is a **visual architecture cheat sheet for Data Engineering**, presented as **clean ASCII-style diagrams** you can quickly recall for learning, interviews, and real projects.

## 1. **Modern Data Engineering Reference Architecture**

```
[ Data Sources ]
   |   |   |
   |   |   └── APIs
   |   └──── Databases (OLTP)
   └──────── Files / Logs
            |
            v
[ Ingestion Layer ]
(Batch / Streaming)
            |
            v
[ Data Lake ]
(Bronze → Silver → Gold)
            |
            v
[ Processing Layer ]
(Spark / SQL Engines)
            |
            v
[ Data Warehouse ]
(Analytics Optimized)
            |
            v
[ BI / Reporting ]
(Dashboards / ML)
```

---

## 2. **Medallion Architecture (Very Important)**

```
BRONZE (Raw)
- Raw data
- No transformation
- Append-only
        |
        v
SILVER (Cleaned)
- Deduplicated
- Validated
- Schema enforced
        |
        v
GOLD (Business)
- Aggregated
- Modeled (Facts & Dimensions)
- Reporting-ready
```

---

## 3. **ETL vs ELT Architecture**

### ETL (Traditional)

```
Source → Transform → Load → Warehouse
```

### ELT (Modern / Cloud)

```
Source → Load → Warehouse → Transform
```

Key Concept:

* ETL = Transform before storage
* ELT = Transform inside warehouse/lake

---

## 4. **Batch vs Streaming Pipelines**

### Batch Pipeline

```
Data (Daily/Hourly)
      |
      v
[ Batch Job ]
      |
      v
[ Storage / Warehouse ]
```

### Streaming Pipeline

```
Events → Queue → Stream Processor → Storage
```

---

## 5. **Data Lake vs Data Warehouse**

```
Data Lake
- Raw & semi-structured
- Cheap storage
- Schema-on-read

Data Warehouse
- Structured data
- Fast analytics
- Schema-on-write
```

---

## 6. **Star Schema (Interview Favorite)**

```
           [ Dim_Date ]
                |
[ Dim_Product ] - [ Fact_Sales ] - [ Dim_Customer ]
                |
           [ Dim_Store ]
```

* Fact table → measures (sales, revenue)
* Dimension tables → context

---

## 7. **Orchestration (DAG Concept)**

```
      Task A
        |
        v
      Task B
     /       \
Task C     Task D
        \     /
         v   v
        Task E
```

Key ideas:

* Dependencies
* Retries
* Failures isolated

---

## 8. **Data Quality Flow**

```
Ingested Data
      |
      v
[ Validation Rules ]
- Null checks
- Range checks
- Duplicate checks
      |
      v
Clean Data or Quarantine
```

---

## 9. **Security Flow**

```
User / Service
      |
      v
Authentication
      |
      v
Authorization (RBAC)
      |
      v
Encrypted Data Access
```

---

## 10. **End-to-End Production Pipeline**

```
Source
  |
Ingestion
  |
Validation
  |
Transformation
  |
Storage
  |
Warehouse
  |
BI / ML
  |
Monitoring & Alerts
```
